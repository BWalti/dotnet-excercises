# Algorithm

The class library [SomeAlgorithm](./SomeAlgorithm/SomeAlgorihtm.csproj) contains a simple [Number utility](./SomeAlgorithm/NumberUtilities.cs)
and can be used to find smallest and largest integers within an `IEnumberable<int>`.

There are two implementations, `GetSmallestAndLargest` and `GetSmallestAndLargestImproved`.

Tasks:
- Read both implementations and discuss the difference.
- Explain which version might perform better and why.
- Then continue to the [SomeAlgorithm.Tests](./SomeAlgorithm.Tests/SomeAlgorihtm.Tests.csproj) project and discuss the existing tests.
